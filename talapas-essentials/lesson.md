# Talapas Essentials: The Structure of Talapas

## RACS
The Talapas (from Chinook for coyote) cluster is managed by [Research Advanced Computing Services](https://racs.uoregon.edu/) or RACS. RACS administers the hardware, software, PIRGS, and other key services for Talapas. Troubleshooting Talapas? Need to request software for your team? The best way to reach RACS is through their [customer portal](https://hpcrcf.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).

## A University Supercomputer

Talapas enables programming tasks that could not be computed without more CPU cores, GPU cores, or memory than are available on consumer hardware.
It also accelerates research at UO by offloading
repetitive, highly parallel computational jobs from researchers' devices, allowing scientists to focus on more important tasks.

Talapas is a heterogenous cluster consisting of hundreds of individual computers called nodes. 
It is made up of login nodes, compute nodes, and private "condo" nodes. 
These nodes are much more powerful than a personal computer! Each compute node can have up to 128 CPU cores. Some specialized nodes for large memory jobs have up to 4TB of RAM.

![talapas-hierarchy](../images/talapas-structure.png)

Talapas is a living, growing computational ecosystem. New software is added upon request, 
CPU and GPU hardware is periodically upgraded, and new computing nodes are added as research groups buy special nodes for their needs.

### Getting to Talapas: Login Nodes

The four login nodes are shared by hundreds of Talapas users simultaneously. 
The login nodes share the same filesystem, but having multiple login nodes adds redundancy and fewer points of failure to the Talapas ecosystem.
They are intended for loading data, transferring large datasets from the internet or the cloud to the Talapas filesystem, preparing software environments, and connecting to IDEs.Unlike other nodes in the cluster, login nodes are open to connections from the broader internet.

The CPU cores and memory on login nodes are **not** for doing computational work.

[There's a detailed tutorial for connecting to login nodes here](../talapas-scripting/setup.html).

### What is `login.talapas.uoregon.edu`?

Talapas has a load balancer at `login.talapas.uoregon.edu`
that  distributes users as evenly as possible among
the four entry or "login" nodes. 

If you connect to `login.talapas.uoregon.edu` through your terminal, you will be routed to one of the four login nodes -- *login1*, *login2*, *login3*, or *login4* -- based on how many people are currently connected to each node.

If connecting directly to a given login node doesn't work, try another. For example, try login1 if login2 times out. If you can't reach *any* of the login nodes, please open a ticket with RACS.

### Compute Nodes
The login and compute nodes share the same filesystem, but
all non-trivial work occurs on *compute nodes*. 

The compute nodes on Talapas are grouped into *partitions* based
on what resources they have, how long those resources can be used, and (in the case of condo nodes) which users can access them.
Each node

## The Talapas Filesystem

Talapas uses a networked filesystem called GPFS to make code, input files, and other crucial pieces of data available across all nodes in the cluster.

All users have 256GB of storage available to them in their home directory at `/home/yourDuckID`. 
No other users have access to your home directory.

You can check your home directory path by using the following Bash command.

```bash
echo $HOME
```

If you have access to Talapas, you are also part of a PIRG. Your research group's data should live in `/projects/PIRG_NAME`.
Unless extra storage has been negotiated, PIRG project directories have a maximum of 2TB of storage. 

Because the [file structure for PIRGs recently changed](https://uoracs.github.io/talapas2-knowledge-base/docs/directory_structure/), some PIRGS may have a slightly different stucture in their `/projects/PIRG_NAME` folder.

You can also explore the filesystem and even upload files of up to 10GB in the [Talapas Files app](../talapas-scripting/setup.html#OnDemand -> Files).

### New PIRGs
Joined Talapas recently? This implementation assumes all files and folders within a PIRG are shared among all members.
That means any files stored in `/projects/PIRG` are, by default, readable by members of that PIRG. 

For example, all members of `racs_training` can access files and folders in the `/projects/racs_training` directory. 
This is why everyone was added to a single, temporary PIRG
for the purpose of sharing files among all members of the workshop.

### Sharing Files in Legacy PIRGs
Older PIRGS were created with the same storage limit but a *different permissions structure*.
This implementation had problems for collaboration among lab members, as labs have members that leave to work at other institutions. 

Each user had their own folder within their PIRG with files their labmates couldn't see at `/projects/PIRG/DuckID`
While all members could access data shared in `/projects/PIRG/shared` 

Shared data was reserved for the folder `/projects/PIRG/shared`, but it wasn't uncommon for lab members to want to share files and folders from their `/projects/PIRG/DuckID` folders with fellow lab members.

### I am a PI and have a legacy PIRG. Can you fix our my group's permissions now that members have left?
Yes, to fix the file structure and permissions within your `projects/PIRG` directory, [open a ticket with RACS](https://hpcrcf.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1). 
RACS can help retrofit your PIRG into a flatter file structure with simpler permissions. 
When your PIRG is modified, you can choose to keep the existing file and permissions structure or have the new file permissions scheme implemented.

### Symlinks
If you do an `ll` or long-listing command on Talapas, you will see special folders in your home directory that begin with `@`.

```bash
ll
```

```output
...
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root  root         26 May 28  2024 library_it -> /projects/library_it/emwin
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root  root         23 Sep  5 16:22 racs_training -> /projects/racs_training
```

These folders aren't *actually* in your home directory. Symlinks or *symbolic links* are references between different locations in the filesystem. If you `cd` into the `/home/racs_training` symlink, you will be redirected or *linked* to `/projects/racs_training`.

These pointers are added for your convenience so that you can move files and code from your home directory to your project directory.

Some new PIRGs do not have this symlink in place. Do not worry, you can still access the same folder through `/projects/PIRG_NAME`. PIs can request that the symlink be added to their lab members' project directories.

## Which Folder Should I Use for What?
`/home/yourDuckID`
- code, testing instances, personal work

`/projects/yourPIRG` 
- datasets, project data, code you want to share with other members of your PIRG

## Transferring Files to Talapas
There are a variety of ways to transfer files to and from Talapas based on your use case.

- To transfer files to Talapas from your web browser you can use the [Talapas file browser](../talapas-scripting/setup.html#OnDemand -> Files). There's 10GB limit on what you can upload at a time.
- To transfer files from the command line, use the `scp` command.
- To transfer datasets to Talapas from the internet, use the `wget http:/<filepath>` command on a **login node**. Remember, compute nodes are firewalled.
- For complex or large-scale transfers, try [Globus](https://uoracs.github.io/talapas2-knowledge-base/docs/data_movement/globus) or FTP tools like [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).

## Software: Modules on Talapas
Software on Talapas is controlled through [lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) modules.

You don't need to worry too much lmod's implementation details to use modules, especially if the software you need is already available in the module catalogue.

To run software from within a Slurm job, you'll need to load the appopriate modules.

For example, let's load Python.
```bash
module load python3
```
<kbd>Tab</kdb> to autocomplete is available to you when searching through the list of modules.

To see the modules you currently have loaded, run `module list`.
```bash
module list
```

```output
Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) miniconda-t2/20230523
  2) python3/3.11.4
```

Now that Python has been loaded, you can access it from your path at `python3`. 
This version of Python has been added to your PATH through lmod.

```bash
which python3
```

```output
/packages/miniconda-t2/20230523/envs/python-3.11.4/bin/python
```


```bash
python3 --version
```

```output
Python 3.10.13
```

To remove a module, use the `module unload` command followed by the module name.

```bash
 module unload python3/3.11.4 
```

Or get rid of ALL modules with `module purge`.

```bash
module purge
```

Now, you can see that there are no modules loaded. 

```bash
module list
```

### Modules and PATH
The lmod system works by modifying your PATH variable.

The PATH variable defines the shellâ€™s search path for executables: the list of directories that the shell looks in for runnable programs when you type in a program name without specifying what directory it is in. 

When you type a command, the shell checks each directory in the PATH variable in turn, looking for a program with the requested name in that directory. As soon as it finds a match, it stops searching and runs the program.

For example, loading Python added `/packages/miniconda-t2/20230523/envs/python-3.10.13` to my path. This is because miniconda is a *dependency* of the Python package.

```bash
module load python3/3.10.13
echo $PATH
```

```output
/packages/miniconda-t2/20230523/envs/python-3.10.13/bin:/packages/miniconda-t2/20230523/condabin:/packages/miniconda-t2/20230523/bin:/packages/miniconda-t2/20230523/envs/python-3.11.4/bin:/packages/miniconda-t2/20230523/condabin:/home/emwin/.local/bin:/home/emwin/bin:/gpfs/t2/slurm/apps/current/bin:/gpfs/t2/slurm/apps/current/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/opt/dell/srvadmin/sbin
```

Talapas also supports compiled languages like C and C++. Compilers like gcc and aocc are available as modules.

### R and RStudio

R can be loaded as a module.

```bash
module load R/4.4.2 
```

To use RStudio with the Talapas filesystem, load the rstudio/base module and launch the GUI application with the 
command `rstudio`.

```bash
module load rstudio/base
rstudio
```

![rstudio](../images/rstudio.JPG)

### Browsing Modules
Want a more user friendly list of modules available?

Try `module spider [keyword]`. Below, I'll search for the neuroscience related software, FSL.

```bash
module spider fsl
```

```output
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  fsl:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Versions:
        fsl/5.0.9
        fsl/5.0.10
        fsl/6.0.1
        fsl/6.0.7
        fsl/6.0.7.9
     Other possible modules matches:
        FSL  FSLeyes  fsleyes  fslpy

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  To find other possible module matches execute:

      $ module -r spider '.*fsl.*'

```

Alternatively, you can use the `module avail` command to get a full list without relying on the spider search mechanism.

```bash
module avail
```

```output
---------- /packages/modulefiles/t2/modulefiles/mpi/gcc/13.1.0 --------------
   mpich/4.1.1 (L)    openmpi/4.1.6

--------------------- /packages/modulefiles/t2/modulefiles ---------------------
   AOCL/4.2.0
   Geneious
   MRIConvert/2.1.0
   Mathematica/11.3
   Mathematica/12.0                                (D)
   NonLinLoc/20221102
   OpenDX/4.4.4
   R/3.4.2-lcni
   R/4.3.2
   R/4.3.3
   R/4.4.2                                         (D)
   RECON/1.08
   RFdiffusion1/RFdiffusion1
   RepeatMasker/4.0.7racs1
   RepeatModeler/1.0.10
   RepeatScout/1.0.5
   adapterremoval/2.1.7
   adapterremoval/2.3.3   
```

You can scroll through the list produced by `module avail` using the arrow keys. Press <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit.

### Reproducibility with Modules
Always use complete module names in your batch jobs and scripts when possible.

For example, `module load fsl/6.0.7.9` is preferred to `module load fsl` because
the default version will change over time. The default version could be out of date.

You should always know which packages and which versions your code relies upon, as it will make it easier for other scientists to **reproduce** your code.

## Talapas Partitions: Where Do I Run My Jobs

Here is a summary of the primary partitions on Talapas so you can decide where to schedule your jobs at a glance.

| Partition | Max Job Time | GPUs | Description | CPU Type |
| ---------- | ----- | --- | --------------------------------- |
| compute | 24 hrs | no | default partition, appropriate for most users | AMD |
| compute_intel | 24 hrs | no | for software that requires *Intel* processors, older computers | Intel |
| computelong | 2 wks | no | default partition for jobs that take longer than 24 hours | AMD |
| computelong_intel | 2 wks | no | default partition for jobs that take longer than 24 hours | Intel |
| gpu | 24 hrs | yes | for shorter jobs that requires GPUs | AMD |
| gpulong | 2 wks | yes | partition for GPU jobs that take longer than 24 hours | AMD |
| interactive | 12 hrs | no | partition for interactive `srun` jobs, OnDemand apps Talapas Desktop, JupyterLab | AMD |
| interactivegpu | 8 hrs | yes | GPU partition for interactive `srun` jobs, OnDemand apps Talapas Desktop, JupyterLab | AMD |
| memory | 24 hrs | no | for memory-intensive jobs that require up to 4TB of RAM | AMD |
| memorylong | 2 wks | no | for memory-intensive jobs that require up to 4TB of RAM of a long duration | AMD |
| *preempt* | 1 wk | yes | [special "partition" that appropriates nodes in other partitions](https://uoracs.github.io/talapas2-knowledge-base/docs/how-to_articles/how-to_use_the_preempt_partition/) | Various |

### Partition Status: `sinfo`

Want to know the current status and time limits of *all* the partitions on Talapas? The command `sinfo` displays all available partitions that **you** can schedule jobs on. (That means condo owners will see a slightly different list.)

```bash
sinfo
```

Each partition has one line for each state in order to list the number of nodes in each of the following states: mix, alloc, and idle.

```output

```
You can interpret the results from `sinfo` as follows. 
Nodes are grouped by partition and state.

* The **AVAIL** column represents the status of partition.
* The **TIMELIMIT** column represents max job time in days. `1-00:00:00` is 24 hours.
* The **NODES** column indicates how many nodes are in the partition have a given state.
* The **STATE** column lists the node states, ie. are the nodes `alloc` allocated, idle, or in a mixture of idle and allocated states.
* The **NODELIST** column lists the node in each of the possible states within a partition. Each node can be
a member of one or more partitions.

To learn more, see the [Slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sinfo.html) for `sinfo`.

If your PIRG has purchased condo nodes, you will see
additional nodes in the list returned by `sinfo`.

The `preempt` partition is a special partition that 
allows users to take advantage of additional computational
resources in a [low-priority queue](https://uoracs.github.io/talapas2-knowledge-base/docs/how-to_articles/how-to_use_the_preempt_partition/). 

Do not run critical jobs on preempt, as there's always
a risk of having your job cancelled.

On any other partition, your job will run until it either
finishes, meets the time limit you requested, or 
exceeds the resources you requested.

## Slurm: The Talapas Scheduler

[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.html) is the job scheduling software used on the Talapas. While Talapas has scheduling policies, partitions, and PIRGs that are specific to UO, 
Slurm is used for job scheduling on high-performance computing clusters around the world.

To schedule jobs on Talapas, you must give Slurm a *partition* where the job must run
and an *account* (PIRG) associated with the job.

Slurm then manages a queue of jobs that determines which node(s) on a partition your job will run.

### Scheduling Simple Jobs with Slurm

To practice with Slurm tasks, connect to a Talapas login node. For this exercise, feel free to use the [Talapas OnDemand shell](https://ondemand.talapas.uoregon.edu/pun/sys/shell/ssh/login1.talapas.uoregon.edu).


Once you're on Talapas, copy this folder of example jobs from `racs_training` to your home directory as follows.
```bash
 cp -r /projects/racs_training/intro-hpc-s25/slurm/part1 .
 ```

Open the job in a text editor of your choice. I have reproduced the contents below.

```bash
 nano hello.sbatch
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --partition=compute              ### Partition (like a queue in PBS)
#SBATCH --account=racs_training          ### Account used for job submission

### NOTE: %u=userID, %x=jobName, %N=nodeID, %j=jobID, %A=arrayMain, %a=arraySub
#SBATCH --job-name=hello_world_python    ### Job Name
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out               ### File in which to store job output
#SBATCH --error=%x-%j.err                ### File in which to store job error messages

#SBATCH --time=0-00:05:00                ### Wall clock time limit in Days-HH:MM:SS
#SBATCH --nodes=1                        ### Number of nodes needed for the job
#SBATCH --mem=500M                       ### Total Memory for job in MB -- can do K/M/G/T for KB/MB/GB/TB
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1              ### Number of tasks to be launched per Node
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1                ### Number of cpus/cores to be launched per Task

### Load needed modules
module purge
module load python3/3.11.4
module list

### Run your actual program
python3 hello.py
```
Let's parse this file using the comments as a guide! To learn more, see the [Slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) for `sbatch`.

* This job runs for a maximum of five minutes
(`0-00:05:00`) on one node and one CPU core of that node.
* It requests 500MB of RAM.
* The job output will be written `hello_world_python-[jobid].out` and `hello_world_python-[jobid].err` respectively.
* It loads the `python3/3.11.4` module.
* It lists the current modules loaded and prints it to standard output.
* It runs a file in the `slurm_examples` directory called `hello.py` that prints to standard output. 

To submit your job file, run the `sbatch` command.

```bash
sbatch hello.sbatch
```

```output
JobID           JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode 
------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------- 
34658037     hello_wor+    compute racs_trai+          1     FAILED      1:0

34658037.ex+     extern            racs_trai+          1  COMPLETED      0:0
```

Look at your job history with `sacct`. Uh oh, there's an error.

Check the error log using `cat`.

```bash
cat hello_world_python-[YOURJOBID].err

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/gpfs/home/emwin/part1/hello.py", line 2, in <module>
    print(dictionary['b']) # Should Raise KeyError !!!
          ~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^
KeyError: 'b'
```

This is a common mistake when using Python dictionaries. 
Check the original Python file in a command line text editor like `nano`.

```bash
nano hello.py
```

```python
print("Hello World !!")

dictionary = {'a': 1}
print(dictionary['b']) # This should raise a KeyError
```

For those of you who don't know Python, this can be fixed by checking the dictionary for a valid entry: `a`.
Change the last line to the following in `nano`, then use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> 
to modify the file.

```python
print(dictionary['a']) # This will not raise a KeyError
```

Now that your file is saved, rerun your fixed job.

```bash
sbatch hello.sbatch
```

```output
Submitted batch job 34658055
```

Running `sacct` will show your job completed successfully.

```bash
sacct
```

```output

```

Check the output log to see the results of your job. You'll want to pick the *second* and later run's log. Note that because each log is named for the jobid, and jobids are unique, your logs will not overwrite each other.

```bash
cat hello_world_python-[yourJOBID].out
```

To check the status of queued jobs, use the `squeue` command. Do not use squeue without an argument unless you want to see *all* the queued jobs on Talapas.

```bash
squeue -u [yourDuckID]
```

To cancel a job, use the `scancel` command followed by the jobid of the job you want to cancel.

```bash
scancel [yourjobid]
```

We will look at Slurm and several associated commands in detail in the next session!
