# Local Development Resources

## MacOS: Bash Shell
Want to enable a Bash shell for your MacOS device's terminal? Both Bash and zsh are built-in, so you can swap to a bash shell at any time by typing `bash` in the terminal and pressing **Enter**.

## Windows: WSL
If you want to use a Windows device as a dedicated tool for **local** software development, considewr installing [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). WSL allows you to run Bash commands and Linux-based software on Windows with a shared filesystem. 

## Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or VS Code is a robust, cross-platform software tool that supports both local and remote development.

## VirtualBox
Virutalization software like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) can be slower and less-lightweight than WSL, but it provides GUI access Linux distributions like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) from Windows and Mac OS devices.
