# Windows Git Installation Guide
Any installation of Git Bash is fine for this workshop. If you have not yet installed Git Bash, we recommend the following configuration:

## Installer Steps
1. Go to the official [Git downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page
2. Select the **Standalone Installer** for your (64-bit) Windows device
3. Check all boxes for
    * Git Bash
    * Start Menu integration
    * Associate .sh files to be run with Bash
    * Use Nano editor by default
    * Default branch name: "main"
    * **Git from the command line** and also from 3rd-party software
    * **Use bundled OpenSSH**
    * **Use the OpenSSL library**
    * **Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings**
    * **Use MinTTY**
    * **Default**
    * **Git Credential Manager Core**
4. Launch Git Bash on completion

## What is this "Git" Anyway?
Git is a version control tool that happens to be bundled with a lightweight and convenient Bash emulator for Windows devices.
