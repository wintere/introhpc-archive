# FAQ 

* My research group does not currently have acccess to Talapas, how do we get access?
    - All users of Talapas must have an associated PIRG. [Only a PI can apply to create a PIRG](https://racs.uoregon.edu/request-access) by emailing racs@uoregon.edu.
* I am a member of a research group with Talapas access. How do I get access too?
    - Faculty, staff, and students in the UO community can apply to Talapas through membership in existing PIRGS using [this form](https://hpcrcf.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/9).
* I need a version of a specific piece of software for Talapas, how do I get it installed?
    - Confirm that software you need isn't available in the existing modules catalog, then [file a ticket with RACS](https://hpcrcf.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).
* Help, I've run out of space in my PIRG's projects folder! What should I do?
    - Ask group members to clean out temporary files and intermediate inputs. Archived data that is no longer needed elsewhere. 
    - If files can't be deleted for permisisons reasons or additional space is non-negotiable, [open a ticket with RACS](https://hpcrcf.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).
* Help, I've run out of space in my home directory. What do I do?
    - Move input and output data to your PIRG's projects folder. 
    - Archive data you no longer need elsewhere.
* Is data on Talapas backed up?
    - No, but there are filesystem backups. Reach out to RACS **immediately** if you accidentally delete important data.
    - If your funding agency requires backups of data, Talapas does not qualify. Consider booking a [data consultation](https://uoregon.libcal.com/appointments/data_services) if you need help finding a compliant backup solution.
* Is there a *web version* of the module catalog? I want to know what software is available on Talapas without logging in.
    - It's in progress.
