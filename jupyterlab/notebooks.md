# JupyterLab Notebooks

You can either work with the notebooks directly from Talapas or reference the HTML versions of the completed notebooks through the navigation menu.

Some of these notebooks reference files on Talapas, so you will need to be a member of the `racs_training` PIRG to execute all the cells.
