## Introduction to High-Performance Computing
UO Libraries, Research Advanced Computer Services (RACS), and the Lewis Center for Neuroimaging are pleased to announce our Introduction to High Performance Computing workshop series!
This workshop is held in-person in the Knight Library DREAM Lab.

Targeted towards computational researchers, these workshops will introduce UNIX commands, bash scripting, file management, OnDemand, Slurm, PIRGs, JupyterLab integration, job management, and other essential Talapas skills. 

This webpage archives notes, slides, and code samples from the workshop series. Excuse the mess as we refactor for Spring 2025!
